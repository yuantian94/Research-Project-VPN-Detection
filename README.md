# Research-Project-VPN-Detection
This is experimental pipeline design for real-time VPN traffic detection research project:
Repo consists of:
  1. Proof of concept
  2. Experimental scripts
  3. Protocol-level VPN/Non-VPN dataset 
  4. Preliminary study results

# Problem statement

# Research landscape
Table of known VPN domains/IPs
  1. Incomplete coverage
  2. Resource-intensive

ISCXVPN2016 or time-related datasets
  1. Low generalizability
  2. Unsuitable for real-time use

Packet payload analysis
  1. Comparable challenges
